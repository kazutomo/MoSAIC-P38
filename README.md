# MoSAIC-P38
The Modular system for Acceleration Integration (`MoSAIC`) is a multi-tiled architecture for accurate and fast exploration of message driven computation.

- `MoSAIC` is written in system-verilog.
- A tile can house a lightweight RISCV processor such as the PICORV32 or a generic accelerator. 
- The tiles are connected through a light-weight network on chip (NoC) following an AXIStream protocol. 
- Each tile has a hardware message queue for inter-tile communication used for message driven computation. 
- A RISCV ISA extension enables straight access to the physical message queue or remote memory through C/C++ primitives (qPut, qGet, qWait, qPoll, mPut, mGet).
- Partitioned global address scheme (PGAS).

## Dependencies
For Icarus Verilog 
- i-verilog (at least version 11)
- vpp
- RV32 Toolchain for systems that involve the PICORV32 processor. Follow: https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32

## Repo Structure

- build: contains header files generated by scripts. Initially empty.
- doc: documentation. 
- icarus: files required to launch a verilog simulation using icarus-verilog.
- models: simple memory and register models for icarus-verilog.
- src: `MoSAIC` source code. 
- tools: helper perl and bash scripts used to setup `MoSAIC` and simulation environment 
  - generate: contains `<testcase>.pl` files with examples for setting up `MoSAIC` and simulations cases. 
  - checkers: simple checkers
  - picorvc: scripts and files required to compile c/c++ code for the picorv32 in `MoSAIC`.
  - vivado_scripts : scripts used for setting up the Vivado project and Vivado IP.
- vivado: directory to host the Vivado project

## How to use

1. Create a testcase:
   A testcase has the details of a particular `MoSAIC` setup. To create a testcase, from the project root go to `tools/generate/` and create a new file `<testcase>.pl` or start from one of the examples such as `mosaic_2x2.pl`. A testcase has at a minimum the information below:
   ```
   #- Set the number of rows (r) and columns (c) in MOSAIC array. I this case a 2x2 for 4 tiles.
   $param{'r'} = 2;
   $param{'c'} = 2;
   
   #- Set the type for each tile
   @tile_array = (['pico', 'spad'],
                  ['loop', 'pico']);
   
   #- Set the firmware to load in each scratchpad
   @pico_program  = ('pico_scratchpad.hex', '', '', 'test_tile_nop.hex');

   #- Set to 1 to run a simulation after setting up the environment
   $param{'run_sim'} = 1;
   ```
   
   If using Vivado add the following lines to the testcase
   
   ```
   #- tell the tools to use vivado as the simulator
   $param{'vivado'} = 1;

   #- tell the tools to create the Vivado project. Warning: Overwrites the Vivado directory.
   $param{'vivado_project'} = 1;
   ```

   If using i-verilog no need to add anything else to the testcase. Go to step 2 or 3.

2. Creating the files and running a simulation:
   In the terminal execute the testcase. *i.e*. `./mosaic_2x2.pl` or `perl ./mosaic_2x2.pl`.
   - The tools generate Verilog header files setting up mosaic. These files are located in the build directory.
   - If `$param{'run_sim'}` is set to `1`, the tool launches a simulation.
     - If using Vivado: a Vivado project is created in the vivado directory.
     - If using i-verilog: the simulation results will be in the icarus directory.

3. Creating the files and running a simulation manually:
   If `$param{'run_sim'}` is not set, or is set to something different than `1` the tool stops at creating the files. To manually launch a simulation:
      - For Icarus: go to the `icarus` folder and execute `launch_sim.sh`
      - For Vivado: go to the `vivado` folder
        - Invoque Vivado. You can use the `launch_sim.sh` script 
        - Create a Vivado project.
        - Add as sources the `build` and `src` directories.
        - For simulation right click at `tb_mosaic.sv` and click on *set as top*. For synthesis set `mosaic.sv` as top.

## Adding an accelerator

Use the `tile_template.sv` in the doc directory to instantiate your accelerator in the tile. Examples of accelerators are : 
- `./src/Tile.HDL/scratchpad_tile/Tile_scratchpad.sv` and 
- `./src/Tile.HDL/loop_tile/Tile_loop.sv`

## Adding support for DDR4

1. From the root go to `tools/generate/`, in there `mosaic_2x2_ddr4.pl` is an example of how to add DDR4 support. Besides the basic features add the following parameters 
      ```
      $param{'ddr4_flag'}       = 1;   #- Add the tile memory manager within mosaic
      $param{'ddr_cache_lines'} = 8;   #- Setup the depth of the cache in the tile memory manager
      $param{'vivado_ip_dram'}  = 1;   #- Adds support for the Xilinx memory controller in the testbench 
      ```
2. In the terminal execute the testcase. *i.e.* `perl ./mosaic_2x2_ddr4.pl`. Verilog header files setting up mosaic are generated in the build directory.
3. In Vivado (Existing project)
    - Source the tcl script in Vivado's tcl window. *i.e.* `source ./<memory_script>.tcl`
    - AMD provides a model for DDR4 memory simulations. Add it to the project if using. 

**Notes**:
- There is an extremely basic testbench designed to respond random data when there are wr/rd requests for the DDR4. It can be used in Icarus and Vivado for basic functionality.  
- To add the Tile memory manager for DDR4 suport and run a simulation without the *Xilinx memory controller* and the *DDR4 model* use:

```
   $param{'ddr4_flag'}       = 1;   #- Add the tile memory manager within mosaic
   $param{'vivado_ip_dram'}  = 0;   #- Instantiate the Xilinx memory controller in the testbenc 
```
