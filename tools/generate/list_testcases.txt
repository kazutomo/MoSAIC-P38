List of testcases:

ICARUS

- mosaic_2x2.pl: PASS
The simplest testcase with 4 tiles: pico, spad, loop.
Runs the firmware located in the directory <>/src/Tile.HDL/picorv32_tile/firmware
A checkers verifies that data is written in the scratchpad and the 
picorv local memory. 

-mosaic_2x2_tile_mem_mgr.pl: PASS/PASS
Adds the tile_mem_mgr module which is the interfaces 
with DRAM.
Since it runs with ICARUS uses a simple always block to 
respond with random data when there is a DRAM access.
The first checker should pass (pico-scratchpad)
The second checker fails because we don't have a dram model.

-mosaic_4x4_tile_mem_mgr.pl: PASS
Example of a larger mosaic with only PICORV32 tiles.
Shows how to add firmware that is in a diferent location.
The check_pkt_cache should pass
because it is only interacting with the cache
and does not require a real DDR4 model.

-mosaic_2x2_long_pkt.pl: FAILS
Simulation does not advance after certain point.
It blocks. FIXME.

----------------------------------------------------------
VIVADO

Similar to previous testcases, but for vivado
-mosaic_2x2_vivado.pl : GOOD
-mosaic_2x2_tile_mem_mgr_vivado.pl : GOOD

-mosaic_2x2_ddr4_8cache_vivado.pl 
Shows how to modify the cache size.

-mosaic_2x2_ddr4_pkt_vivado.pl 
It is a very fast test, the PICOs don't do anything
It only injects packets that go to the tile 
memory manager

-mosaic_2x2_u250.pl      
Shows how to setup the development board.

-mosaic_cache.pl
Shows how to generate MoSAIC where the
PICORV tile has separate DATA and INSTRUCTION memory.
The instruction memory is a cache that gets
data from DRAM.

-mosaic_fp.pl
Adds Mario's Floating Point units.
